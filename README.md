- 👋 Hi, I’m Adrien,
  After a 10 year carreer in education, I decided to change path and freshly became a web developer thanks to @le_Wagon's bootcamp. 
  
- 👀 I’m interested in quite a lot of things and tend to find and get myself new passions as life passes by. Coding would be the newest one among many others: basketball, music, magic, mechanic, golfing, collecting musical instruments....
  
- 🌱 I’m currently working on a Book Suggestion Delivery web app, using React.JS and Next.JS frameworks, to get to lay hand on Typescript and JS frameworks to top the incredible training I had on Ruby and ROR at @le_Wagon. 
  
- 💞️ I’m actually working as a Freelancer, mostly doing nocode, which is not what I like best but hey, gotta pay the bills and this still is a great experience!

- 🎸 I'm working on a few personal projects at the moment as well. First, my personal website but also a basketball game which will be online soon and that Book Suggestion Delivery website for people who like reading and need new and fresh good reads !
  
- 📫 How to reach me:
You can absolutely  contact me through my email address : adrien.regis@gmail.com
And in the weeks to come, through my personal website : https://www.adrien-regis.site
