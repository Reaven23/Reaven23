- 👋 Hi, I’m Adrien,
  After a 10 year carreer in education, I decided to change path and freshly became a web developer thanks to @le_Wagon's bootcamp. 
  
- 👀 I’m interested in quite a lot of things and tend to find and get myself new passions as life passes by. Coding would be the newest one among many others: basketball, music, magic, mechanic, golfing, collecting musical instruments....
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning typescript and node JS to top the incredible training I had on Ruby and ROR at @le_Wagon. 
  
- 💞️ I’m actually looking for my first job as a web developer!

- 🎸 I'm working on a few personal projects at the moment as well. First, my personal website but also working with my team on our group project started at Le Wagon and that we are trying to push.
First, to learn, but also to keep that project alive. "Hide N'Seek", coming soon.
  
- 📫 How to reach me:
You can absolutely  contact me through my email address : adrien.regis@gmail.com
And in the weeks to come, through my personal website : https://www.adrien-regis.site
